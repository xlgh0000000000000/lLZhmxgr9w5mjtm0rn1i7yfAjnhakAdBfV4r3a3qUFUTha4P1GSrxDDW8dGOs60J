xyl.lol is now closed due to a lack of time and interest in continuing the project.

we plan to continue the project in the future. 
our user database will be preserved unless you specifically request to delete your account. (requests in email)
although we'll probably come back in a few months, you can still request a refund if you've bought premium.

for account deletions & premium refunds: admin@xyl.lol

thank you for using xyl! ðŸ¥¶
